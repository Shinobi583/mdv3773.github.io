                        Introductory laboratory course in biological chemistry. Experiments deal with methods of protein
                        and
                        DNA isolation, measurements, amplification, and characterization.

                <li>
                    <strong>Evolutionary Biology</strong> (BIO200 at the University at Buffalo)â€‹ during the 2018 and
                    2019 Fall semesters.
                    <p>
                        This course is designed as a general introduction to organismal biology: what happens at the
                        level
                        of the organism and above. Students will learn how evolution works, what organisms evolution has
                        created, and how those organisms interact with the environment and each other. These three
                        topics
                        comprise the three sections of the course material: evolution, diversity, and ecology. Students
                        will
                        gain a general facility with the major topics of each of these fields to prepare them for future
                        courses in the biology department and related fields.
